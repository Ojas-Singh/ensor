# Spectral Clustering based fragmentation approach for ab-initio Quantum Calculation of large molecules

#### Ojas Singh and Aaditya Mishra 



## Abstract 

A Spectral Clustering based fragmentation scheme for estimating the electronic energy of a large molecule at *ab-initio* level of theory is presented. The method exploits few property of Graphs for heuristically predict best possible fragments and overlaps.  In the tests performed, energy  estimates obtained from this method show an excellent agreement  with  those  obtained  from  actual  computation of full molecule. Accuracy of the results obtained deploying  this method  provides possibility for the Quantum calculation to very large molecules.

## INTRODUCTION

If one can divide a species of interest into fragments, employ some  level of ab-initio QM to calculate the wave function, energy, and  properties of each fragment, and then combine the results from the  fragment calculations to predict the same properties for the whole, the  possibility exists that the accuracy of the outcome can approach that  which would be obtained from a full non fragmented calculation.



## METHODOLOGY

### Molecule as a Graph

Treating Molecule as a Graph permit us to apply knowledge of Graph Theory for tackle extremely sophisticated problem heuristically and reach end goals.
Reliability of Operations on a Graph representing a molecule, depends on how well the graph is representing the molecule geometry and interactions.
